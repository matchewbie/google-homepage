My deconstruction and rebuild of the current Google homepage (Oct 2019)

This was a great project for me to brush up on my rusty HTML and CSS knowledge. It actually took me longer than expected at ~4-5hrs of actual working time--after subtracting a bunch of breaks--while rethinking layout and how to apply the CSS IDs and classes as not to repeat myself. It may not be perfect, but I am here to learn and progress.

One thing I'm proud to have accomplished is building the Google Apps vector icon using purely CSS!
